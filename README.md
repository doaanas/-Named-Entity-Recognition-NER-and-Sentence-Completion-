# -Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-and-Sentence-Completion-

Overview
This project aims to create a web application using Streamlit that leverages Hugging Face's pretrained models for Entity Named Recognition (NER) and Sentence Completion. The app allows users to input text, identify entities within the text, and generate completions for sentences using state-of-the-art natural language processing models.

Features
Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Utilize Hugging Face's pretrained NER models to identify and label entities such as persons, organizations, locations, etc., within the input text.
Highlight entities in the text output for easy visualization.
Sentence Completion:
Provide sentence completion suggestions based on the input text using Hugging Face's language models.
Predict the next words or phrases to complete the sentence contextually.
User-Friendly Interface:
Interactive input field for entering text.
Buttons to trigger NER analysis and sentence completion generation.
Display panels to show the identified entities and completed sentences.

GitHub Repo:
The source code for this project is hosted on GitHub to encourage collaboration and further development.
Technologies Used

Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Hugging Face Transformers Library: For accessing pretrained NLP models.
Python: For backend processing and integration with Hugging Face models.

How to Run
Clone the GitHub repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Streamlit app locally using the command streamlit run app.py.
Access the web application in your browser to perform NER and sentence completion tasks.
